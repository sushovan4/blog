<theorem data-title="Pythagorean" data-number="1">
  If $AB$, $BC$, and $CA$ denote the sides of a right-angled triangle, then
  $$AB^2+BC^2=AC^2$$
</theorem>

<p>The above theorem immediately implies the following corollary:</p>
<corollary data-title="Formula of Sum" data-number="1.2">
  We can easily see that 
  $$\sin^2{\theta}+\cos^2{\theta}=1$$
</corollary>
